# Lucene
Capstone Project - Ad Hoc Retrieval

A basic search and retrieval program for our Capstone project using Apache Lucene. The code will index a given corpus, will search 
using topics and return a ranked list of documents based on TF-IDF scores. Code is based on example Lucene files taken 
from lucence.apache.org. Code has been modified to work with TREC_eval program.
