# Lucene
Capstone Project - Ad Hoc Retrieval

A basic search and retrieval program for our Capstone project using Apache Lucene. The code will index a given corpus, will search 
using topics and return a ranked list of documents based on TF-IDF scores. Code is based on example Lucene files taken 
from lucence.apache.org. 

The IndexFiles.java file will create an index on the specified corpus. The SearchFiles.java file will search the index using a specificied list of topics, and return a ranked list of documents based on calculated TF-IDF scores. The code has been modified to work with the TREC_eval program.
